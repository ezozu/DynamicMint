# DynamicMint: A Decentralized NFT Marketplace Framework

A powerful and efficient framework for building decentralized NFT marketplaces, designed for optimized gas usage and seamless ERC-721/ERC-1155 trading.

## Detailed Description

DynamicMint provides a robust foundation for creating custom NFT marketplaces on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It addresses the common challenges faced by NFT developers, such as high gas costs, complex metadata management, and fragmented trading experiences. This framework leverages on-chain metadata aggregation, enabling efficient search and filtering of NFTs based on various attributes without relying solely on external data sources. This approach enhances transparency and decentralization, eliminating single points of failure associated with centralized metadata servers.

The core of DynamicMint lies in its gas-optimized smart contract interactions. The contracts are meticulously designed to minimize gas consumption during listing, buying, selling, and transferring NFTs. This is achieved through techniques like batch operations, optimized data storage, and efficient function calls. The framework supports both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, allowing for the trading of unique and multi-edition NFTs within the same marketplace. Furthermore, DynamicMint is built with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily integrate custom features and functionalities, such as royalty implementations, auction mechanisms, and advanced trading strategies.

DynamicMint also streamlines the developer experience by providing a well-defined API and comprehensive documentation. This enables rapid development and deployment of custom NFT marketplaces, reducing the time and resources required to build a fully functional platform. The framework promotes a modular architecture, allowing developers to selectively utilize different components based on their specific needs. By addressing the core challenges of NFT marketplace development, DynamicMint empowers creators and entrepreneurs to build innovative and scalable NFT trading platforms.

## Key Features

*   **On-Chain Metadata Aggregation:** Facilitates efficient searching and filtering of NFTs using on-chain metadata, improving transparency and decentralization. Specifically, the framework utilizes a data structure on-chain to store key-value pairs representing NFT attributes, reducing reliance on off-chain storage.
*   **Gas-Optimized Smart Contracts:** Minimizes transaction costs through optimized contract design, batch operations, and efficient data storage, ensuring affordable trading experiences. Gas usage is reduced further by minimizing unnecessary state changes and utilizing efficient assembly code in critical functions.
*   **ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Support:** Enables trading of both unique and multi-edition NFTs within the same marketplace, providing flexibility and versatility. The contracts intelligently route interactions based on the NFT standard, ensuring compatibility and proper handling of each type.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Allows for easy integration of custom features such as royalty implementations, auction mechanisms, and advanced trading strategies, providing flexibility and customization options. This is achieved through well-defined interfaces and event emission patterns, allowing for custom modules to seamlessly interact with the core framework.
*   **Comprehensive API:** Provides a well-defined API for interacting with the smart contracts, enabling rapid development and deployment of custom NFT marketplaces. The API includes methods for listing, buying, selling, transferring, and querying NFTs.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** Built using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and improved code maintainability, resulting in a more robust and reliable framework. The use of TypeScript also allows for better code completion and error detection during development.
*   **Modular Design:** Promotes a modular architecture, allowing developers to selectively utilize different components based on their specific needs, enhancing flexibility and customization. Each module is self-contained and can be easily replaced or extended without affecting other parts of the system.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Used for writing the smart contracts and client-side logic for improved code maintainability and reduced runtime errors.
*   **Solidity:** A contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum. Used for developing the core marketplace logic.
*   **Hardhat:** A development environment for Ethereum software. Used for compiling, testing, and deploying the smart contracts.
*   **Ethers.js:** A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. Used for interacting with the smart contracts from the client-side.
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment. Used for running the development environment and client-side applications.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DynamicMint.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd DynamicMint
3.  Install the dependencies:
    npm install
4.  Install Hardhat globally (if not already installed):
    npm install -g hardhat

## Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Define the following environment variables:

    *   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum private key for deploying and interacting with the contracts.
    *   `NETWORK`: The Ethereum network to deploy to (e.g., `mainnet`, `ropsten`, `rinkeby`, `goerli`, `sepolia`, `localhost`).
    *   `INFURA_API_KEY`: Your Infura API key (required for connecting to Ethereum networks).

    Example `.env` file:

    PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere
    NETWORK=sepolia
    INFURA_API_KEY=YourInfuraApiKey

3.  Configure `hardhat.config.ts` with the desired network settings and compiler versions.

## Usage

1.  Compile the smart contracts:
    npx hardhat compile
2.  Deploy the smart contracts:
    npx hardhat deploy --network <network_name> (e.g., npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia)
    Note the deployed contract addresses.

3.  Interact with the contracts using Ethers.js:

    const { ethers } = require("ethers");
    const DynamicMintContractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";
    const DynamicMintContractABI = [...]; // Your contract's ABI

    async function listNFT(tokenId, price) {
        const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.INFURA_API_KEY); // Or other provider
        const signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
        const dynamicMintContract = new ethers.Contract(DynamicMintContractAddress, DynamicMintContractABI, signer);

        try {
            const transaction = await dynamicMintContract.listNFT(tokenId, ethers.utils.parseEther(price));
            await transaction.wait();
            console.log("NFT listed successfully!");
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error listing NFT:", error);
        }
    }

    listNFT(1, "0.01");

    Detailed API documentation for each function within the smart contracts can be found in the comments within the Solidity source code. Each function's input parameters, return values, and gas considerations are explained.
